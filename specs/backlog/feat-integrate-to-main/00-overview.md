> **Stack:** worktree

## Problem

Finishing an isolated spec has a hand-driven tail. `/spec-complete` verifies,
archives, and offers teardown — but the branch is still stranded on its worktree.
Landing it on `main` (rebase → fast-forward → re-test) is done by hand every time,
and then two rough edges bite: the teardown guard treats a fully-*merged* branch
as "unpushed" whenever there's no remote (so local-only repos always need
`--force`), and teardown removes the worktree but leaves the merged branch behind.
The last mile of the lifecycle should be one guarded flow, not manual git.

## Decisions

1. **Integrate lives in `/spec-complete`, opt-in and isolation-only.** After the
   archive move, `/spec-complete` optionally integrates the spec's branch into the
   base branch, then offers teardown — one coherent finish flow. Only active when
   `specs/.core/env.config.json` exists and the spec has a worktree; otherwise
   `/spec-complete` behaves exactly as today. Rejected a separate `/spec-land`
   skill — completion already owns "finalise + archive + offer teardown", and
   landing is the missing middle, not a separate ceremony.
2. **Rebase + fast-forward (linear history).** Rebase the branch onto base in the
   worktree, then `merge --ff-only` base to it. On a rebase conflict: `git rebase
   --abort`, report, and hand back to the user — never leave a half-done rebase.
   Rejected merge-commits (non-linear graph) and a per-run rebase/merge prompt
   (extra friction in the finish flow).
3. **Teardown treats "merged into base" as safe, and deletes the merged branch.**
   Relax the unpushed guard to block only when `unpushed && !mergedToBase`, so a
   completed+integrated spec tears down without `--force`. Add a safe
   `git branch -d <branch>` (merged-only — never `-D`) to the teardown plan.
4. **Base branch is resolved, not hardcoded.** Precedence:
   `config.baseBranch ?? origin/HEAD ?? main ?? master`. Shared by both the
   integrate step and the teardown "merged" check. Adds an optional `baseBranch`
   field to `env.config.json`. Rejected hardcoding `main` (breaks `master`/`trunk`
   repos and repos with no remote HEAD).
5. **Never auto-push; require a clean worktree.** Integrate stays local — it does
   not push `main` (the skill may *mention* pushing). It refuses to run on a dirty
   worktree: the completion edits must be committed first, preserving
   `/spec-complete`'s "don't `git commit` unless asked" rule (it offers `/commit`).
6. **Same engine pattern.** Pure planners (`planIntegrate`, extended `planDown`)
   take git facts + config and emit the exact command sequence; the CLI queries
   git for those facts (base resolution, clean/merged/divergence, conflict
   handling); the skills execute the printed commands. No `Date.now()`/live git in
   the planners — keeps them unit-testable, matching `src/env/*`.

## Solution overview

**Base resolution (`src/env/resolve.js`).** `resolveBaseBranch(config, gitQuery)`
returns the base branch by the Decision-4 precedence. Consumed by the teardown
guard and the integrate planner.

**Teardown (`src/env/teardown.js`).** `planDown` gains a `mergedToBase` input on
`ctx.worktreeState`; the unpushed guard becomes `unpushed && !mergedToBase`. The
command list gains `git branch -d <branch>` after `git worktree remove`. The CLI's
`worktreeGitState` computes `merged` via `git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD <base>`.

**Integrate (`src/env/integrate.js`, new).** `planIntegrate(spec, config, ctx)`
resolves base, blocks on a dirty worktree, no-ops when the branch is already merged
/ not ahead, else emits:

```
git -C <worktreePath> rebase <base>
git -C <mainRepoPath> merge --ff-only <branch>
```

The `/spec-complete` skill runs these; on a rebase non-zero exit it runs
`git -C <worktreePath> rebase --abort`, reports the conflict, and stops (teardown
is not offered). On success it re-runs the project's test command against the base
checkout before reporting.

**CLI.** New `skitterspec spec-env integrate <spec>` subcommand — queries git,
prints the plan (or the guard block / no-op). `spec-env down` output additionally
lists the `git branch -d` step.

**`/spec-complete` flow (isolated + config present):** verify green → update spec
→ archive move → **[new] commit gate + integrate to base + re-test** → offer
teardown (now `--force`-free for a merged spec, and it deletes the branch).

## Open questions

- [ ] `mainRepoPath` resolution for the ff step — the primary checkout, via
      `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` (parent) or the first `git worktree list`
      entry. Confirm which is robust when the CLI is invoked from inside a worktree.
- [ ] Conflict pre-flight: attempt-and-abort (Decision 2) vs a side-effect-free
      `git merge-tree --write-tree` pre-check. Default to attempt-and-abort; note
      merge-tree as a possible enhancement if a half-second rebase churn matters.

## Changelog

- 2026-07-09 — Spec created. Grilled to: integrate step folded into
  `/spec-complete` (opt-in, isolation-only); rebase+ff with abort-on-conflict;
  teardown treats merged-into-base as safe and deletes the merged branch; base
  branch resolved (`baseBranch ?? origin/HEAD ?? main ?? master`); never auto-push,
  clean-worktree precondition. Two phases: teardown/base infra, then integrate.
