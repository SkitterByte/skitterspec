description: Configure Azure Boards sync for this repo by interview rather than by hand — asks for the organization, the project, the work item types and the state names, validates the answers against Azure, then writes specs/.core/azure-boards.config.json. Safe to re-run; an existing config is reviewed, never overwritten without consent. Use when the user says "/spec-azure-setup", "set up Azure Boards sync", "connect this repo to Azure DevOps", "configure azure-boards.config.json", or "check my Azure setup".

Writes `specs/.core/azure-boards.config.json`, the file that switches one-way
Azure Boards sync on for this repo. You **interview**; the engine
(`spec-sync init-config`) **validates and writes**. Keep that split: composing
the JSON yourself is how a malformed config gets committed, and the engine
already rejects everything the loader would later reject.

The gap this closes is not "I can't remember my org URL" — it's that nothing
ever asks which project this repo's work files into and which states its
lifecycle maps to, so the config ends up describing a shape nobody confirmed.
Ask about structure first; the values fall out of the answers.

## 1. Check what already exists

Read `specs/.core/azure-boards.config.json`.

- **Absent** — this is a first-time setup. Carry on.
- **Present** — say so and default to **reviewing** it, not replacing it: run
  the checks in steps 2 and 5 and report where the live config disagrees with
  the org (a project that no longer resolves, a state that was renamed). That
  is the most useful thing a re-run can do. Only write when the user asks for
  it, and then pass `--force`.

## 2. Credentials first

The interview validates its answers against Azure, so settle authentication
before asking anything:

```
skitterspec spec-sync credentials status
```

If nothing is set, tell the user to run this **themselves**, in their own
terminal:

```
skitterspec spec-sync credentials set
```

It prompts for a Personal Access Token (hidden), created in Azure DevOps under
User settings → Personal access tokens, with **Work Items (Read & Write)** —
and **Identity (Read)** too if the org wants user search later (work item sync
is whole without it).

**Do not ask the user to paste a PAT into this conversation, and do not offer to store one for them.**
A credential pasted into a chat enters the transcript, is sent to the model,
and may be logged — moving where it is stored is pointless if it travels
through the conversation to get there. Your job is to confirm the setup is
ready and name the command; the values are theirs alone.

**Degrade, never block:** with no credentials and no MCP connection the answers
cannot be validated. Say so in one line —
*"Azure not reachable — can't validate the answers"* — point at the manual path
(`azure-boards.config.md`, the field reference beside the example config), and
**stop without writing anything**. A half-written config is worse than none:
every other command switches on the moment the file exists.

## 3. Which organization, and which project?

- **Org URL** — `https://dev.azure.com/<org>`. It also keys the
  credentials-store entry, so it must be the same org `credentials set` was
  given.
- **Project** — the Azure DevOps project name.

**This config pins exactly one project for the whole repo**, and every spec
work item lands there **by construction** — there is no per-spec picker
(`azure.areaPath` places items inside the project when the team wants one).
Say that plainly, because it reframes the question: it isn't "which project do
you like", it's *"which product's work does this repo hold"*. If the repo
genuinely spans two projects, sync can't express that today: say so, and offer
the two honest options — pick the project that owns most of the work, or split
the repo's specs across two checkouts. Don't invent a workaround.

## 4. Which work item types?

Boards' types are **process-defined** — Basic has Issue/Task, Agile has
User Story/Task, a custom process has whatever it has — which is exactly why
these are config rather than constants:

- **`azure.workItemType`** — the type a spec mints as. Default **Issue** (the
  Basic process's); an Agile project usually wants `User Story`.
- **`azure.childType`** — the type a phase mints as, created as a hierarchy
  child. Default **Task**.

Offer the defaults and take yes for an answer — this is a confirmation, not an
interrogation.

## 5. Check the state names

```
skitterspec spec-sync states --json
```

It prints the configured types' state names (the union across both), exactly as
Azure spells them — and reaching them is the setup's first real end-to-end
check: a wrong org URL, project or PAT fails here, while the user is still in
the setup conversation. Relay a failure with its fix rather than pressing on.

Then settle the four bucket→state names against that list:

- `backlog` → `To Do` · `in-progress` → `Doing` · `complete` → `Done` by
  default, and `cancelled` → `Done` too, because the Basic process carries no
  Cancelled state (Agile's `Removed` is an honest override where it exists).
- **Validate every non-default answer against the `states` output** before
  writing. A state is written directly, but Azure refuses an unknown name only
  **at write time** — after the description already landed — so a name the
  process lacks would half-apply the first push. Catching a renamed `Done` here
  is the whole reason this step exists.
- Where a configured or offered name is not in the list, show the real names
  and ask which one means that bucket here — the mapping is the user's call,
  never a guess.

Each answer that differs from the defaults becomes a `--state <bucket>=<name>`
flag in step 6.

## 6. Write it

```
skitterspec spec-sync init-config \
  --org-url https://dev.azure.com/<org> --project <project> \
  [--work-item-type Issue] [--child-type Task] \
  [--state <bucket>=<name> …] [--force] [--json]
```

The engine writes **only the keys that differ from the defaults**, so the file
shows this repo's choices and keeps inheriting everything else. `--force` is
required to replace an existing config — never pass it without the user having
asked for a rewrite in step 1.

**Relay the engine's report as printed.** It names the org, the project, the
types and the state mapping it wrote — that report is the evidence the setup is
right, so don't paraphrase it into "done".

## 6b. Let `/spec-start` commit the snapshot with its spec

**Only when `specs/.core/env.config.json` exists** (per-spec isolation is on).
If it is absent, skip this — there is nothing to configure.

**Check before you write — a fresh install may already have this.** When this
superset's `init --isolation` wrote the `env.config.json`, both keys below are
seeded; this step is the **retrofit** for a project that adopted isolation
before installing the Azure Boards provider, or ran `/spec-azure-setup` before
adopting it.

`/spec-start` commits an uncommitted spec for you, but only the paths it can
prove belong to that spec. Its own folder always does; this repo's per-spec
Azure snapshot (`sync.baseDir`, `specs/.core/azure-base/<ID>.base.json`) does
not, because the base engine is deliberately tracker-free and cannot know that
path exists. Declare it once, in `env.config.json`:

```json
"spec": {
  "companionPaths": ["specs/.core/azure-base/{identifier}.base.json"]
}
```

`{identifier}` resolves through `branch.identifierField`, so **set that too** if
it is still empty — `"azure_identifier"` is the field `/spec` stamps. Without
it the pattern expands to nothing and the snapshot is treated as another spec's
file: `/spec-start` then refuses the tree instead of committing it, which is the
safe failure but a needless one.

Leave both alone if the user has already set them.

## 7. Report and hand off

**Finish by checking, not by describing.** Run:

```
skitterspec spec-sync doctor
```

and relay its table. That is the difference between a summary of what setup
*meant* to do and a check of what is actually true — including the layers this
skill never touched (the scaffold, isolation). Every row that needs attention
names its own fix, so there is nothing to paraphrase.

It exits non-zero only when a layer is **broken** — configured but wrong. A
`missing` row is an opt-in nobody took, which is fine; report it, don't treat
it as a failure.

Then name the next step:

- `/spec` — write a spec; with Boards configured it creates the linked work
  item in the configured project and stamps the id.
- `/spec-status` — read-only drift report, the safe way to prove the link works.
- `/spec-push` — send a spec up.

Mention what setup did **not** configure, so the defaults aren't mistaken for
decisions: phase mapping (`mapping.phases` — child item per phase by default),
field ownership, intake tags (`intake.bugTags`/`hotfixTags`) and the release
carrier (`releases.*`). Point at `azure-boards.config.md` for those. Identity
is settled lazily — `spec-sync whoami` derives it from the PAT on first use and
caches it, so there is nothing to configure here.

End with the block defined in `.claude/rules/spec-reports.md`. That file carries
the shape; this section carries only what is specific here.

**The `doctor` table goes above the block, verbatim.** It is a check rather than
a summary, and every row that needs attention names its own fix — paraphrasing
it into fields would lose exactly that.

**Verdicts**

- `✅` — every layer `doctor` checked is configured and working.
- `⚠️` — configured, with a `missing` row: an opt-in nobody took, which is fine.
  Report it; do not treat it as a failure.
- `❌` — a `broken` row: configured but wrong. Relay the row and its fix.
- `⏸` — an existing config was reviewed and left alone, or Azure could not be
  reached. Nothing was written.

**Fields:** `Built` · `Follow-ups` · `Next`

`Built` is the config written or reviewed, plus what was deliberately left
unset. **The credentials are never a field** — `doctor` already reports whether
they are set, masked, and the values are the user's alone.
