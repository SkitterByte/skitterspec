# /spec-claim — take a spec, hand it back, or hand it over

Ownership lives in the repo: the spec's frontmatter records who is building it,
and the push that follows tells Linear. This skill is how that record changes
after `/spec-start` has set it — a hand-off mid-flight, a spec picked up from
someone who moved on, or work a lead is distributing.

**Opt-in.** Needs `specs/.core/linear.config.json` *and* `assignee` in its
`sync.fieldOwnership`. If either is missing, say which one and stop — without the
field the stamp would sit in the file doing nothing.

## 1. Identify the target spec

The argument, else the spec in flight for this session, else ask. Unlike
`/spec-next` this does not refuse a spec you are not standing in: reassigning a
colleague's spec from your own checkout is a normal thing to want, and it writes
no code.

## 2. Work out the mode

| Invocation | Mode |
|------------|------|
| `/spec-claim [<spec>]` | **take** — you are building it |
| `/spec-claim [<spec>] --release` | **release** — nobody is |
| `/spec-claim [<spec>] --to <name-or-email>` | **hand over** — they are |

### take

1. `skitterspec spec-sync whoami --json`. If it answers, use that `id`/`name`.
   If it reports `transport = mcp`, call the user-read tool with `me` and cache
   the answer with `whoami --set <id> --name "<name>"`.
2. **If the spec already records someone else, confirm before taking it** —
   name them and say what will happen. Taking a colleague's spec by accident is
   the one mistake here worth a round trip; every other path is reversible with
   a second `/spec-claim`.
3. Stamp it: `skitterspec spec-sync assign <spec> --to <id> --name "<name>"`.

### release

`skitterspec spec-sync assign <spec> --release`. This removes the stamp and, on
the next push, unassigns the Linear issue.

**It does not clear `> **Developer:**`** — that header records who *actioned*
the work, which outlives who is currently holding it. If nobody will pick the
spec up, `/spec-cancel` is the honest move; releasing only says "not me, for
now".

### hand over (`--to`)

1. **Resolve the person through a search, never a typed id.** Run
   `skitterspec spec-sync users <name-or-email>` (or the user-list tool on MCP)
   and **confirm the match** before writing. This is the one path where the repo
   writes into somebody else's Linear inbox, so a mistyped id would assign a
   stranger and nothing downstream would notice.
2. On several matches, show them and let the user pick. On none, say so and
   stop — do not fall back to the raw argument as an id.
3. Stamp it with the resolved id and display name.
4. Set `> **Developer:**` to that person's display name, so the visible header
   and the assignment agree.

## 3. Record it in the spec

Add a dated line to the **Changelog** in `00-overview.md` — who it moved to (or
from), and why if the user said. Ownership is a course-correction, not a
lifecycle transition, so it belongs there and **not** in the State log.

## 4. Push

Run `/spec-push`. The stamp is repo state, and the mirror catches up like any
other edit.

**If the push fails, the claim still stands.** Say so and stop: the repo is
correct, the mirror is disposable, and the next push repairs it. Do not roll the
stamp back — that would throw away the one durable half of the change.

## 5. Report

One or two lines: who owns it now, and whether Linear agrees yet.
