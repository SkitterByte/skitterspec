/**
 * Main guard — the harness half.
 *
 * `main` is where work **lands**, not where it happens. The skills say so, and
 * a skill is prose: it can be chained past, typed around, or simply not read.
 * So the rule is also enforced one level down, where an `Edit` or a `Write` is
 * a tool call the harness has to ask about first.
 *
 * IT REFUSES THE FIRST WRITE, NOT THE COMMIT, and that is the whole reason it
 * is a different hook from `review-gate.cjs` rather than another branch inside
 * it. Nothing has been written when this fires, so the fix costs one command —
 * `/no-spec <name>` and carry on. A commit-time gate fires once the work
 * already exists in the primary checkout, and in worktree mode moving it is the
 * genuinely painful part: the primary checkout cannot `switch -c` out from
 * under the other worktrees.
 *
 * THIS SCRIPT DECIDES NOTHING. It reads the tool call, hands the directory to
 * `spec-env main check`, and turns one exit status into an answer. Every
 * judgement — is isolation configured, is this the primary checkout, is HEAD
 * the base branch, is an allow in force — lives in the engine, where it is unit
 * tested. A hook with its own opinions is a second implementation that nothing
 * can test and nobody remembers to update.
 *
 * IT FAILS OPEN, EVERYWHERE, for the same reasons `review-gate.cjs` does and
 * with more at stake, because this one fires far more often. No engine, an
 * unreadable payload, a repo with no isolation, a crash of its own — all of
 * them allow the write. Being wrong the permissive way costs one edit on a rule
 * the skills also carry; being wrong the other way costs someone their work
 * with no idea why (`.claude/rules/negative-checks.md`).
