/**
 * Review gate — the harness half.
 *
 * `/spec-next` refuses to build the next phase while a review is owed, but a
 * skill is prose: it can be chained past, typed around, or simply not read. So
 * a phase ending is also enforced one level down, where a `git commit` is a
 * tool call the harness has to ask about first.
 *
 * THIS SCRIPT DECIDES NOTHING. It reads the tool call, hands the command line
 * to `spec-env review gate --check --for-command`, and turns one exit status
 * into an answer. Every judgement — is this a commit, is a verdict owed, is
 * this project even using the gate — lives in the engine, where it is unit
 * tested. A hook with its own opinions is a second implementation that nothing
 * can test and nobody remembers to update.
 *
 * IT FAILS OPEN, EVERYWHERE. No engine on the machine, an unreadable payload, a
 * repo with no isolation, a spec it cannot resolve, a crash of its own — all of
 * them allow the commit. Blocking one is an accusation
 * (`.claude/rules/negative-checks.md`), and the only thing worth accusing on is
 * the engine saying, positively, that this spec owes a verdict. Being wrong the
 * other way costs one unreviewed commit, on a gate the skills also enforce;
 * being wrong this way costs someone their commit with no idea why.
