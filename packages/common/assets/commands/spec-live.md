!`{{exec}} skitterspec spec-env live $ARGUMENTS`

Relay the engine output above verbatim. Add nothing and run nothing else.

The engine enforces every refusal itself and prints why — a hotfix, a stateful
spec (`Stack: worktree + docker`), a branch touching migrations, a dirty tree, a
rebase conflict, or another spec already holding the instance. Do not re-explain
or work around any of them.
