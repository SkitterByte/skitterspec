# /spec-start — put a spec in flight

One checkout, one spec in flight. This skill is how a spec gets there:
provision, move it to `in-progress`, refresh the tracker, then hand straight on
to `/spec-next` for phase 1. Continuing a spec afterwards is `/spec-next`;
finishing it is `/spec-complete`.

## 1. The gate — refuse unless the workbench is free

**Check this first, before resolving anything or touching a file.** What the
gate demands depends on the mode, because the two modes hold work in different
places — read `mode` from `specs/.core/env.config.json` (default `worktree`).

**`worktree` mode — the tree must be clean, and that is all.** The spec is built
in its own worktree, so another spec being in flight is not a conflict; it is the
parallelism the mode exists for. The only requirement is that this checkout has
no uncommitted work — *except* the spec you are starting, which `spec-env up`
commits for you (see below). Nothing is switched here and nothing is parked.

**`checkout` mode — the workbench must be free**: on the base branch (`main`, or
the configured `baseBranch`) and clean, since the branch is built right here and
this mode holds one spec at a time. If it isn't, relay what is in flight and
stop — name the spec holding the checkout and the two ways out, then end your
turn:

- **`/spec-complete`** — it's finished; land it and free the workbench.
- **`/spec-cancel`** — it isn't wanted; record why and free the workbench.

**Never get past the gate yourself.** Do not stash, do not commit **another
spec's** work, do not switch branches for them. An uncommitted tree and a
half-built phase are each a decision someone must make deliberately — and the
cost of guessing is another spec's work moved without its author asking. A
refusal costs one command; the alternative can cost an afternoon.

**The one exception is the spec you are starting.** `spec-env up` classifies the
uncommitted tree against the target spec and answers one of three ways — relay
what it says rather than deciding for yourself:

| What it found | What it does |
|---------------|--------------|
| clean | provisions, as always |
| every path belongs to this spec | plans `git add` + `git commit` **first**, then the fork |
| any path does not | refuses, naming the paths that disqualified it |

That is membership in an exactly-known set — the spec's own folder plus the
project's `spec.companionPaths` — and **not** a judgement about whether the
changes look important. The gate still never decides that. When it plans the
commit, the paths are printed above the commands, so run them as printed; when it
refuses, relay the reason and stop.

It also refuses a **clean** tree whose spec is not in the commit the worktree
would fork from — otherwise you get a branch missing the very spec it is for.

## 2. Identify the spec

- Use the name/path argument when given.
- Otherwise use the spec **in context** (the one just created or discussed).
  Unlike `/spec-next`, that fallback is safe here: this skill starts nothing
  without the gate above passing, and a wrong guess is caught by the operator
  before any code is written.
- Locate it under `specs/` — `specs/backlog/` first, then the other buckets. A
  spec is a `<name>/` folder whose entry point is `00-overview.md`, with one
  file per phase beside it (`01-<slug>.md`, `02-…`). Legacy specs may be a bare
  `<name>.md`, or a `00-overview.md` with inline phases — handle those too.
- A spec already in `specs/in-progress/` was started before. Its worktree
  probably still exists, so this is a re-attach: say so rather than reporting a
  fresh start, and skip the housekeeping that is already done.

## 3. Build its branch

### `worktree` mode

1. **Provision.** Run `skitterspec spec-env up <name>` — a planner, so run the
   `to provision, run:` commands it prints and confirm they succeeded. Then run
   its **`then, in the worktree, run:`** steps in order (file seeding, then
   `setup`): a fresh worktree has no dependencies and none of the repo's
   gitignored files, so hooks, typechecks and tests fail until they are there.
2. **The branch stays in its worktree.** That is where the spec is built — it is
   what the mode is for, and it is why `main` stays free and several specs can run
   at once. Do the step 4 housekeeping there with `git -C <worktreePath>`, then run
   `open.command` if one is configured, print the worktree path, and say to run
   **`/spec-next`** from a session in it.
   **Do not move the branch into this checkout**, and do not ask the operator to.
   `/spec-live` is for testing a finished-enough spec on the already-running dev
   server; it is not the way work gets started, and reaching for it here is what
   used to split a start across two invocations.
   **Trust the worktree first.** `spec-env up` wrote the printed `trusted:` root
   into `.claude/settings.local.json`, but that file will not hot-reload in this
   session — run `/add-dir <trusted root>` before editing into the worktree, or
   the first write prompts.

### `checkout` mode

Run `skitterspec spec-env up <name>` and the single `git switch` it prints.
There is no worktree, no bootstrap and no hand-off — the checkout is already the
workbench. Its planner enforces the same gate from the engine side, so relay any
refusal and stop.

## 4. Move the spec into development

**Do this before any hand-off**, so no path can end with a provisioned worktree
and a spec still reading `Ready` in `specs/backlog/`. In `worktree` mode run it
against the worktree with `git -C <worktreePath>`; in `checkout` mode the branch
is already here.

- `git mv "specs/backlog/<name>" "specs/in-progress/<name>"` if it isn't there
  already (`mkdir -p specs/in-progress` first). Use `git mv` to keep history.
- Set the **Status** header: `> **Status:** In Progress — Phase 1 (started <YYYY-MM-DD>)`.
- Set **Developer** if it is still `—` (`git config user.name`).
- Append a **State log** row: `| <YYYY-MM-DD> | In Progress | in-progress | <git user.name> |`.
- **Commit it, and push the branch.** One commit, the spec's own — it records the
  in-progress state for everyone and fires the tracker's automation. Do this
  *before* the tracker refresh below, so the snapshot that refresh writes is
  swept up by the phase's own commit rather than left dirty.

A spec ideally arrives `Ready` from `/spec`; a `Draft` works too — sanity-check
it is well-formed first.

## 4b. Note a missing gating decision (only if configured)

**Only when `specs/.core/gating.config.json` exists.** Run
`skitterspec gating check <name>` and, if it names this spec, mention it **once**
before phase 1 starts — the cheapest moment to decide is before any code exists.

**This check is advisory.** It reports; it never refuses, and nothing below is
conditional on it. A spec written before the project adopted gating has no header
and is not broken — turning this into a gate would accuse the very specs the
feature was designed not to disturb.

## 5. Bring the spec's dev servers up — confirm before heavy steps

**Only when the project configures host dev servers** (`env.config.json` → a
non-empty `dev` array). Show what will start — the commands, the ports, any
Docker stack — and get a yes; on **`--plan`**, print it and stop. On
confirmation run `skitterspec spec-env dev up <name>`. With none configured this
is a clean no-op.

To reach the spec at your normal `localhost` URL afterwards, the **user** types
**`/spec-connect <name>`** (`/spec-connect main` hands the ports back). Never
invoke it yourself.

## 6. Build phase 1

**`checkout` mode — carry straight on into `/spec-next`** in this session: it
marks phase 1 started, refreshes the mirror again, builds it with tests and
reports. Do not stop and ask the operator to run it: the branch is here and they
asked to start the spec.

**`worktree` mode — the spec is built in its worktree**, so this invocation ends
with it provisioned, housekept and a session opened there. Say that plainly and
tell them to run `/spec-next` in it.

`/spec-next` resolves the spec it is *standing in* — the live spec of the
checkout, the worktree its cwd is inside, or the branch in `checkout` mode — and
a name argument narrows a re-run rather than selecting a spec elsewhere. That
refusal is deliberate: building the wrong spec's phase writes commits on a branch
nobody asked for. **Do not work around it**, and do not offer to build the phase
from here.

## Opt-outs

- **`--plan`** — print the provisioning and dev-server plan, change nothing.
- **`--no-worktree`** — skip provisioning and build on the current branch. Warn
  that the work lands wherever you are (usually the base branch); reserve it for
  a trivial change or an explicit request.

There is no `--here`: `/spec-start` **is** here. It puts the branch in the
checkout you are in, which is what the old opt-out was reaching for.

## Why there is no tracker seam here

This skill creates no spec and mints no issue, so it has nothing to link — the
intake and picker steps belong to `/spec`, `/spec-bug` and `/spec-hotfix`. The
state change it *does* make (the spec moving to `in-progress`) is mirrored by
the refresh `/spec-next` runs the moment it starts, which pushes the issue state
and the phase states together. Adding a push here would send the same thing
twice, one commit apart.
