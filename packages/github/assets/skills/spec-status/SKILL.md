Read-only. Reports two things and writes nothing:

1. **Pending push** — has the spec changed since the last push (is there an issue
   description/state or any phase sub-issue to create or update)?
2. **State drift** — does GitHub's issue status differ from the spec's status?
   (Push resends State only when the spec itself moves, so a card moved by
   hand stays where it was put until then. This is a heads-up, not a pending
   change.) A state skitterspec does not map is reported as
   `state: … left alone`, never as drift, and a `states` alias reads as its
   bucket.

The repo is the source of truth; GitHub is a generated mirror, so there is no
per-field "conflict" — only "what would the next push send" and "did the mirror
drift".

**Opt-in**: only runs when `specs/.core/github.config.json` exists. If absent,
tell the user how to enable GitHub sync and stop.

## 1. Identify the target spec

Use the argument, else the spec in context; ask if unclear.

## 2. Fetch the GitHub issue (optional, for drift)

If the spec has a `github_identifier`, discover the GitHub MCP read tool
(`issue_read`) and write the issue JSON to a temp file, with its board item's
Status as `state: { name }` — an issue's own `open`/`closed` is not its state. If GitHub isn't
connected, skip the drift lines (still report pending-push).

**Write the whole issue, including its `description`.** The engine reports two
independent kinds of drift off that one file: the status someone moved, and the
**description someone edited**. Write only the status fields and the second
check has nothing to look at — and it says nothing rather than guessing, so the
loss is silent. Keep `url` too: it is what the description line points the
reader at.

**The description itself never enters the conversation.** The engine hashes it
and compares hashes; what it prints is *that* the text changed, plus where to
read it. Do not open the temp file, and do not paste the description into your
report.

Optionally fetch the board's Status options to a file to validate the
configured `states` at the same time.

## 3. Run the engine

```
skitterspec spec-sync status <spec> [--remote <issuefile>] [--workspace-states <statesfile>]
```

- Reports `push: pending — N to create, M to update` or `up to date`.
- With `--remote`, adds a `drift:` line comparing the board's Status to the
  spec's status. A state that maps to no bucket gets a `state:` line
  instead — position, not drift.
- With `--workspace-states`, fails loudly if a configured state name isn't a
  Status option on the board (the push would refuse at apply time).

## 3b. A wrong repo is a different problem

If the spec's `github_url` names a **different repo** than `github.owner` /
`github.repo` in `specs/.core/github.config.json` — a repo renamed or
transferred, or a spec copied in from elsewhere — the stamps point at issues
this repo's config does not reach. That is not push drift and `/spec-push`
cannot fix it: it fails with `no GitHub issue found for #<n>`. GitHub redirects
a transferred repo's URLs, but the API does not follow the old name.

There is no `retarget` for GitHub yet. Re-stamp by hand with
`spec-sync stamp <spec> --issue #<n> --url <new url>`, or fix the config if it
is the config that is stale.

## 4. Report

Relay the engine's output **verbatim, above the block** — it is the answer, and
the block is the verdict on it. Never write to either side.

End with the block defined in `.claude/rules/spec-reports.md`. That file carries
the shape; this section carries only what is specific here.

**Verdicts**

- `✅` — in sync; nothing would push.
- `⚠️` — drift: N objects would push, GitHub's status was moved by hand, or the
  issue's **description** was edited on GitHub since the last push. None is an
  error, but all are the reason someone ran
  this. **Say which**, since the three call for different things: a pending push
  is routine, a moved status is usually someone else's automation, and an edited
  description means a person wrote something that the next push replaces.
- `⏸` — no config, or the spec is not linked. Nothing to compare.

**Fields:** `Tracker` · `Follow-ups` · `Next`

`Tracker` is the drift in one line — what would push, and whether the tracker's
status diverged. `Next` is `/spec-push` when a push is pending, and nothing to
do when it is not.

A **`phases: <mode>`** line names the phase mode that resolved for this spec's
lifecycle bucket, and appears only when it is not the default `subissue`.
`mapping.phases` may be a per-bucket map, so this is the only place the mode a
given spec got is stated. Under **`inline`** the phases live in the spec issue's
description rather than as sub-issues, so "0 to create" is the expected shape
rather than a sign the phase files failed to parse; under **`deferred`** the
`N phase(s) deferred` line above it says how many are still waiting on
`/spec-next`. Relay both lines as printed.
