/**
 * Fail the `npm version` run if anything unexpected is staged.
 *
 * Runs as the LAST step of the npm `version` script, after the generators have
 * written and staged the changelog / release-notes files.
 *
 * Why a post-check and not a pre-check: npm already refuses to start when the
 * working directory is dirty ("Git working directory not clean"), so a file
 * another session staged BEFORE the release aborts it for us. What npm does not
 * cover is the window during the version script itself — the seconds our
 * generators run. Anything staged in that window is swept into npm's commit,
 * because npm commits with a bare `git commit` and no pathspec (verified: a
 * file staged mid-script lands in the version commit).
 *
 * We cannot bound npm's commit. We can refuse to reach it: a non-zero exit here
 * aborts the run before the commit and the tag are created.
