# Commit Messages

## Format

`type(scope): subject` — [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)

## Length limits

- **Subject line:** 50 characters max
- **Body lines:** 72 characters max

(These match the common commitlint defaults — if your project runs commitlint,
they'll be enforced; otherwise treat them as the convention.)

## Template

```
type(scope): subject

- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
```

## Types

`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `style`

## Rules

- Start bullets with a verb (Add, Fix, Refactor, Remove, Update)
- Be specific about what changed (file, module, feature)
- No emojis, no trailing punctuation
- No **authorship** trailers — `Co-authored-by`, `Signed-off-by`, etc.
  (The `Release-Note:` footers below are the one permitted exception — they
  carry content, not attribution.)
- Use plain `git commit -m "message"` only
- Output ONLY the commit message — no explanations before or after

## Release notes footer (user-facing changes)

When a change is **user-visible** (a feature, fix, or improvement an end user
would notice), add a `Release-Note:` footer. The terse subject feeds the
dev-facing changelog (`CHANGELOG.md` by default); the footer feeds the
user-facing release notes (`RELEASES.md` by default) via
`scripts/generate-releases.js`, run at `npm version`. Both are generated from
the same commit. Filenames, the product name, and the scope→area map are
configured in `skitterspec.config.json` (this whole section applies only when
the release tooling is installed — see the project README).

```
feat(tasks): explicit state/created dates + sort-by

- Add stateEnteredAt column, sortBy param

Release-Note: You can now sort your task inbox by when an item entered its
current state or when it was created, with both dates shown on every row.
```

Grammar:

- `Release-Note: <text>` — a plain-English, benefit-framed sentence aimed at
  users (not "add column X" — say what they can now do). Multi-line is fine;
  wrap continuation lines at 72 like the body.
- `Release-Note!: <text>` — same, but also promoted into the release's
  **Highlights** line. Use for the headline change of a release.
- `Release-Area: <name>` — optional. Overrides the scope→area mapping (from
  `skitterspec.config.json` → `releases.scopeAreas`) when the dev scope isn't a
  user area (e.g. scope `engine` but area `Platform`).
- `Release-Note: none` — explicit "not user-facing" marker (same effect as
  omitting it; documents the decision).

Rules:

- **Opt-in.** Omit the footer for internal/dev-only changes (`chore`, `test`,
  `docs`, `style`, refactors with no user effect, plumbing). Only commits with a
  footer appear in `RELEASES.md`.
- Put a **blank line before** the footer (so it's a proper commit footer).
- `feat`→New, `fix`→Fixed, `perf`/`refactor`→Improved, breaking→Action required
  — the bucket is derived from the commit type, so just write the note.

## Abbreviations

Common short forms are fine in subjects — e.g. `config`, `ctx`, `impl`, `util`,
`id`, `repo`. List any project-specific abbreviations your team allows in your
own `.claude/rules/`.
